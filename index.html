            device. IP addresses, for purposes of this Privacy Policy, include
            “public” IP addresses, such as the IP address for a home router that

            are IP addresses assigned to computers and mobile devices “behind” a
            router (such as a home router). Our advertising and analytics
            partners may use IP addresses to group or correlate devices for
            purposes of analytics, security and anti-fraud purposes,
            interest-based advertising, ad targeting, ad attribution, and
            limiting ad frequency.

        <li>
          Right to data portability: You have the right to receive the Personal

          directly, where technically feasible, except for the data that has
          already been anonymized by us.
        </li>
        <li>
          Right to erasure: You have the right to ask us to delete your Personal

          retain a limited amount of data for a period of time - including, in
          situations that the storage of the information is authorized by law
          and or required by law.
        </li>
        <li>
          Right to information about public and private entities with which
          ActiveWork has shared data through communication, dissemination,
          international transfer, interconnection of personal data or shared
          processing of banks of personal data by them.
        </li>
        <li>
          Right to information about the possibility of denying consent and the
          consequences of such denial;
        </li>
        <li>
          Right to withdraw consent: You have the right to withdraw your consent
          to our processing of your Personal Data, as permitted by law, and
          where the basis for processing was based on your consent.
        </li>
        <li>
          Right to object: When the legal basis for processing your data is
          anything other than consent, you can object to the processing when it
          is not in compliance with the law.
        </li>
        <li>
          Right to review automated processing decisions: You have the right to
          review decisions taken solely on the bases of automated processing of
          personal data that affects your interests. This includes decisions
          intended to define your personal, professional, consumer or credit

        under the heading “How We Disclose Personal Data” if we are permitted to
        do so under applicable European and national data protection laws and

      <p style="font-style: italic">Health Data</p>
      <p>
        Some Fitness and Wellness Data that we collect may be considered
        personal health data under the GDPR as interpreted by the European data
        protection supervisory authorities if recorded over a longer period of
        time. We process this type of data to provide you with additional
        information that you can incorporate into your evaluation of your
        progress toward your fitness and wellness objectives; it should not,
        however, be considered professional medical advice and is not intended
        to be used for diagnostic purposes.
